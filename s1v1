void main() {
  print("Welcome to the world of Dart by masteringflutter.com");
  print(" ");
  print("This is first code in Dart language");
}

/*
Points to be taken care of:
1) void is a return type
2) main() is a function / method ...that you will get used to later in
this course
3) "p" for print should be small and Since we are printing String
(ie: Text) so, it should be within double quotation.
4) Print statement should end with semicolon ;
5) After writing your program, click on the Run button.
